        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Alishba Ansari and I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Political Science with a concentration in International Affairs. I am very interested in global issues, social justice, governance, and the intricate dynamics of international relations. My interest in this field not only revolves around analyzing the political systems of different nations, but is deeply intertwined with my culutral heritage and my strong passion to address social injustices. Growing up, I have always been inspired by the richness of my culture which fuels my want doe advocacy and change for a better future for everyone.<br><br>

        From a young age, I have always been interested in how policies affect marginalized communities. My passion for social justice allows me to facilitate important conversations about addressing inequality and the importance of human rights. I have participated in many initiatives like fundraisers and protests aimed at raising awareness, creating change, and supporting those in need. No matter where or when the conversation occurs, I believe it is crucial to spark change in every conversation if granted the opportunity to do so. A key factor to my motivation is striving to be an active part of the solution, not just sympathizing with issues.<br><br>

        Creativity also plays a grand role in a cornerstone of my identity. Along with my studies, I run a henna business that celibrate my creativity and the artistry that keeps me connected to my culture. Having the ability to use my hands to create beautiful, unique and traditional designs on others keeps me motivated in putting a smile on others' faces. Whether I am adorning a bride on her big day or creating custom designs for special events such as prom, henna allows me to express my creative side alongside my academics. In my academic career, I have been involved in many projects such as fundraisers, research, and presentations that allow me to explore the intersections of different cultures, politics, social justice, and the need for human rights everywhere. The intersection of gender equality, human rights, and women's health, especially within the context of my South Asian heritage has promoted me to create a positive change. Growing up, I keenly observed the disparities in treatment between genders, where societal expectations often treated my brothers differently than me. This stark contrast fueled my determination to empower and uplift women within my community, inspiring my creation of the club “Chnge4Women” at my high school.

Being a South Asian woman, I felt a personal connection to the cause as I had witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by women in my community. Cultural norms often perpetuated gender-based inequalities, limiting opportunities for women in education, career, and personal autonomy. I was driven by the desire to break these barriers and create a platform that would challenge stereotypes and foster a more inclusive and equitable society.

Chnge4Women was a vehicle to instill a sense of empowerment within my community. We tailored our activities to address the unique challenges faced by women everywhere, creating a space where cultural sensitivity and understanding were paramount. 

 Through the club, I aimed to inspire other young women to challenge societal norms, pursue their aspirations, and be proud of their identity.

Chnge4Women became the embodiment of this vision. We organized panels that delved into the nuances of gender disparities, incorporating discussions on cultural influences and their impact on women's lives. 

These panels were strategically held around the school to initiate dialogue and challenge preconceptions, fostering a sense of awareness among the student body.

Our school-wide presentations served as a powerful tool to disseminate information and ignite passion among our peers. By showcasing the interconnectedness of gender equality, human rights, and women's health on a global scale, we aimed to inspire our generation to be advocates for change.

These endeavors were not just about raising awareness but also about fostering a sense of solidarity among the students, irrespective of cultural background.
